# PasswordManager
#Intermediate level
Managing passwords yourself is a hell of a job and if u are like me with tons of passwords for various sites and apps, use this simple yet secure password manager which locally stores your credentials in the passwords.json and user_data.json files.

>To Note:
1.  If one opts for seeing the saved websites without saving any, they will face an error.
2.  Need to have a copy mechanism installed

    ```
    sudo apt-get install xsel
    ```
    or
    ```
    sudo apt-get install xclip
    ```
    or
    ```
    pip install gtk   - WIn
    ```
    or
    ```
    pip install PyQt4  -win
    ```
