# PasswordManager
#Intermediate level
Managing passwords yourself is a hell of a job and if u are like me with tons of passwords for various sites and apps, use this simple yet secure password manager which locally stores your credentials in the passwords.json and user_data.json files.

To Note:
If one opts for seeing the saved websites without saving any, they will face an error.
