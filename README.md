# PasswordManager
#Intermediate level
Managing passwords yourself is a hell of a job and if u are like me with tons of passwords for various sites and apps, use this simple yet secure password manager which locally stores your credentials in the passwords.json and user_data.json files.

To Note:
1.  If one opts for seeing the saved websites without saving any, they will face an error.
2.  NEED TO HAVE A COPY PASTE MECHANISM INSTALLED IN THE SYSTEM <br>
    sudo apt-get install xsel
    sudo apt-get install xclip
    pip install gtk   - WIn
    pip install PyQt4  -win
    and etc.
    
Open to suggestions and pull requests.
